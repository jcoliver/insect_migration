#So the general idea here is to start to build the feature set to feed into a ML model. 
# Feature list: 
# 1. Date of first sighting in the US (previous year)
# 2. Number of sightings N of 37 ยบ
# 3. Total # of sightings between March and October
# 4. Active time environmental conditions (March-October) (precip, avg temp, avg max temp)
# 5. Others (start with what is above)

#First step is setting up the dataframe that all of this will populate
monarch_ml_df = monarch_winter


#inspecting
print(monarch_ml_df, n=30)

#Changing dates to December dates - i.e. the year reflects the year in December, not in January when the records were collected. 
monarch_ml_df$year = monarch_ml_df$year - 1

#Finding the date of first sighting by year
monarch %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  filter()
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(first_sighting = min(date))
