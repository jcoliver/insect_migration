#quickmap
monarch %>%

#So the general idea here is to start to build the feature set to feed into a ML model. 
# Feature list: 
# 1. Date of first sighting in the US (previous year)
# 2. Number of sightings N of 37 ยบ
# 3. Total # of sightings between March and October
# 4. Active time environmental conditions (March-October) (precip, avg temp, avg max temp)
# 5. Others (start with what is above)

#First step is setting up the dataframe that all of this will populate
monarch_ml_df = monarch_winter

#inspecting
print(monarch_ml_df, n=30)

#Changing dates to December dates - i.e. the year reflects the year in December, not in January when the records were collected.
