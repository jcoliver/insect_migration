#Reading in the data
monarch = read_csv("./data/monarch_gbif_inat_full.csv")
monarch_winter = read_csv("./data/monarch_winter.csv")

#Adding some geocode information to the monarch data
monarch_loc = monarch %>%
  select(longitude, latitude)

#Generating a list of loc vectors to feed into revgeocode
loc_ls = map(transpose(monarch_loc), unlist, use.names = FALSE)

#applying revgeocode to the items in the list (beware, this takes a while)
locs = lapply(loc_ls, function(x) revgeocode(x, override_limit = TRUE)) 

#So the general idea here is to start to build the feature set to feed into a ML model. 
# Feature list: 
# 1. Date of first sighting in the US (previous year)
# 2. Number of sightings N of 37 ยบ
# 3. Total # of sightings between March and October
# 4. Active time environmental conditions (March-October) (precip, avg temp, avg max temp)
# 5. Others (start with what is above)

#First step is setting up the dataframe that all of this will populate
monarch_ml_df = monarch_winter

#inspecting
print(monarch_ml_df, n=30)

#Changing dates to December dates - i.e. the year reflects the year in December, not in January when the records were collected. 
monarch_ml_df$year = monarch_ml_df$year - 1

#Finding the date of first sighting by year
monarch %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  filter()
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(first_sighting = min(date))
